# Contents of version 0.2.0

## Added

- Blue underlining on the active tab.

## Change

- Change the entire color scheme to a blue base, including the sidebar and status bar.
- The light blue color makes it easy to see.
- Changed the color scheme of the menu to brighter, because it was too dark in `v0.1.0`.
- The color of the `title bar` and `menu text` was matched to other colors.If only this part is black, it is not beautiful.
